The goal in the bin packing problem is to pack objects of various sizes into bins of fixed capacity in such a way that the total number of bins used in minimized. Each bins has a fixed capacity and no bin can contain objects whose size exceeds the bin's capacity.

## How to run the files

Make sure you are in the root directory.<br>
Run `make` and followed by `./binPackingTest`<br>

After any changes to a file, run `make` to recompile so that `./binPackingTest` will have the new updated code.

### Clean up

After compiling and running the test, to clear all object files created during the compilation, run `make clean`. This will automatically remove the files created during compilation without affecting the source code.
